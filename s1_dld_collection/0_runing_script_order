from 1_* to 13_*

Note: 
you need to come back to 1 after 2_* (detailed in 1_*)

!!!Make sure path_tab_scop_FA_continuous_uni_multi_parse_domian and path_pdb_chain_unp have the same number of PDB chains/entries;
- 4_ and 6_1_* make changes of the file. They should be updated together of any PDB chain/entry is excluded.
- re-run 5_* after 6_1* (path_tab_scop_FA_continuous_uni_multi_parse_domian and path_pdb_chain_unp is updated there), then re-run 6_1* and continue.

path_pdb_chain_unp will be used for S2_analysis to generate the residue-level labelling for ML usage.
