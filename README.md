# The Domain-Linker-Domain (DLD) dataset

The DLD dataset identifies Independent Domain Linkers (IDLs) by extracting high-quality domain annotations from SCOP2, filtering for multi-domain proteins, and refining linker regions using DSSP-based secondary structure analysis.

A two-step smoothing process helps distinguish 1,640 IDLs and 647 Dependent Domain Linkers (DDLs), alongside other protein regions. The dataset is mapped to UniProt, providing a comprehensive resource for studying disordered flexible linkers and enhancing computational predictions.
